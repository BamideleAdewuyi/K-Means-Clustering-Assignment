Repository contains a .py file with a k-means and k-medians clustering algorithms and clustering data.

The code then plots the B-Cubed precision, recall and F-scores.

Running the code
Run the code in compatible software (e.g. Spyder or VSCode).
You will be prompted, "Press 1 for K-Means. Press 2 for K-Medians. Press 0 to quit.".

To run K-Means with unnormalised data, press 1, 1.
This will return a list of fScores paired with the corresponding value of 
k and the plot with scores for k = 1-9.
Close the plot.

To run K-Means with normalised data, press 1, 2.
This will return a list of fScores paired with the corresponding value of k and
the plot with scores for k = 1-9.
Close the plot.

To run K-Medians with unnormalised data, press 2, 1.
This will return a list of fScores paired with the corresponding value of k and
the plot with scores for k = 1-9.
Close the plot.

To run K-Medians with normalised data, press 2, 2.
This will return a list of fScores paired with the corresponding value of k and
the plot with scores for k = 1-9.
Close the plot.
Press 0 to quit.
